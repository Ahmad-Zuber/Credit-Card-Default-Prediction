# Credit-Card-Default-Prediction
# <b><u> Project Title : Predicting whether a customer will default on his/her credit card </u></b>
## <b> Problem Description </b>

### This project is aimed at predicting the case of customers default payments in Taiwan. From the perspective of risk management, the result of predictive accuracy of the estimated probability of default will be more valuable than the binary result of classification - credible or not credible clients. We can use the [K-S chart](https://www.listendata.com/2019/07/KS-Statistics-Python.html) to evaluate which customers will default on their credit card payments
## <b> Data Description </b>

### <b>Attribute Information: </b>

### This research employed a binary variable, default payment (Yes = 1, No = 0), as the response variable. This study reviewed the literature and used the following 23 variables as explanatory variables:
* ### X1: Amount of the given credit (NT dollar): it includes both the individual consumer credit and his/her family (supplementary) credit.
* ### X2: Gender (1 = male; 2 = female).
* ### X3: Education (1 = graduate school; 2 = university; 3 = high school; 4 = others).
* ### X4: Marital status (1 = married; 2 = single; 3 = others).
* ### X5: Age (year).
* ### X6 - X11: History of past payment. We tracked the past monthly payment records (from April to September, 2005) as follows: X6 = the repayment status in September, 2005; X7 = the repayment status in August, 2005; . . .;X11 = the repayment status in April, 2005. The measurement scale for the repayment status is: -1 = pay duly; 1 = payment delay for one month; 2 = payment delay for two months; . . .; 8 = payment delay for eight months; 9 = payment delay for nine months and above.
* ### X12-X17: Amount of bill statement (NT dollar). X12 = amount of bill statement in September, 2005; X13 = amount of bill statement in August, 2005; . . .; X17 = amount of bill statement in April, 2005.
* ### X18-X23: Amount of previous payment (NT dollar). X18 = amount paid in September, 2005; X19 = amount paid in August, 2005; . . .;X23 = amount paid in April, 2005.

# **Business Objective:**


* **Objective of our project is to predict which customer might default in upcoming months. Before going any further let's have a quick look on defination of what actually meant by Credit Card Default.** 


* **We are all aware what is credit card. It is type of payment payment card in which charges are made against a line of credit instead of the account holder's cash deposits. When someone uses a credit card to make a purchase, that person's account accrues a balance that must be paid off each month.**




* **Credit card default happens when you have become severely delinquent on your credit card payments.Missing credit card payments once or twice does not count as a default. A payment default occurs when you fail to pay the Minimum Amount Due on the credit card for a few consecutive months.**

* **So now we know what a credit card is. Now let's see one of problems faced by companies who provide credit cards. Yes it is the peolpe who do not clear off the credit card debt aka credit card defaulters**.

* ***The research aims at developing a mechanism to predict the credit card default beforehand and to identify the potential customer base that can be offered various credit instruments so as to invite minimum default.***

* ***AGE: Age in years***

**Scale for PAY_0 to PAY_6** : 

***(-2 = No consumption, -1 = paid in full, 0 = use of revolving credit (paid minimum only), 1 = payment delay for one month, 2 = payment delay for two months, ... 8 = payment delay for eight months, 9 = payment delay for nine months and above***)

* ***PAY_2: Repayment status in August, 2005 (scale same as above)***

* ***PAY_3: Repayment status in July, 2005 (scale same as above)***

* ***PAY_4: Repayment status in June, 2005 (scale same as above)***

* ***PAY_5: Repayment status in May, 2005 (scale same as above)***

* ***PAY_6: Repayment status in April, 2005 (scale same as above)***

* ***PAY_AMT2: Amount of previous payment in August, 2005 (NT dollar)***

* ***PAY_AMT3: Amount of previous payment in July, 2005 (NT dollar)***

* ***PAY_AMT4: Amount of previous payment in June, 2005 (NT dollar)***

* ***PAY_AMT5: Amount of previous payment in May, 2005 (NT dollar)***

* ***PAY_AMT6: Amount of previous payment in April, 2005 (NT dollar)***

* ***default.payment.next.month: Default payment (1=yes, 0=no)***

**NOTE:-**

 **What do 0 and -2 mean in PAY_X columns?**

***From dataset documentation:***

**PAY_0: Repayment status in September, 2005 (-1=pay duly, 1=payment delay for one month, 2=payment delay for two months, â€¦ 8=payment delay for eight months, 9=payment delay for nine months and above). Notice code 0 and 2 are in the PAY_X columns but are not included in the data description. Also by doing the value_counts, it shows 0 is the most frequent observation**. 
 
#### -2: No consumption; <br>-1: Paid in full; <br>0: The use of revolving credit, meaning the payment wasn't due, which makes sense that most customers were using the revolving credit.
